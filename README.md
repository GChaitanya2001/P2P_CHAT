# P2P_CHAT

## Objective:
* The objective of this repo is to use the functionalities of the select() system call
through a network application - a Peer-to-Peer Chat Application. 

* In this applicaion there are no dedicated central server nodes.

* Every node in the network can connect with each other and transfer data among themselves.

* The chat application uses TCP as the underlying transport layer protocol.

* Every instance of the chat application runs a TCP server (we call this as
peer-chat server) where the chat application listens for incoming connections.

## Languages:
C

## Note:
* Check report for more details on implementation and usage.
